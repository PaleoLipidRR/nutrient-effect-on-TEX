#   Abstract: The recent completion of drilling at Vostok station in East Antarctica has allowed the extension of the ice record of atmospheric composition and climate to the past four glacial–interglacial cycles. The succession of changes through each climate cycle and termination was similar, and atmospheric and climate properties oscillated between stable bounds. Interglacial periods differed in temporal evolution and duration. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane correlate well with Antarctic air-temperature throughout the record. Present-day atmospheric burdens of these two important greenhouse gases seem to have been unprecedented during the past 420,000 years.

#   Abstract: Direct evidence of past atmospheric CO2 changes has been extended to the past 160,000 years from the Vostok ice core. These changes are most notably an inherent phenomenon of change between glacial and interglacial periods. Besides this major 100,000-year cycle, the CO2 record seems to exhibit a cyclic change with a period of some 21,000 years.

#   Abstract: Interpretation of the past CO2 variations recorded in polar ice during the large climatic transitions requires an accurate determination of the airice age difference. For the Vostok core, the age differences resulting from different assumptions on the firn densification process are compared and a new procedure is proposed to date the air trapped in this core. The penultimate deglaciation is studied on the basis of this new air dating and new CO2 measurements. These measurements and results obtained on other ice cores indicate that at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase is either in phase or lags by less than about 1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, while it clearly lags the temperature at the onset of the last glaciation.

#   Abstract: Methane measurements along the Vostok ice core reveal substantial changes over the past 160,000 years which are associated with climate fluctuations. These results point to changes in sources of methane and also show that methane has probably contributed, like carbon dioxide, to glacial-interglacial temperature changes.

#   Abstract: The ice-core record of local temperature, dust accumulation and air composition at Vostok station, Antarctica, now extends back to the penultimate glacial period (~140–200 kyr ago) and the end of the preceding interglacial. This yields a new glaciological timescale for the whole record, which is consistent with ocean records. Temperatures at Vostok appear to have been more uniformly cold in the penultimate glacial period than in the most recent one. Concentrations of CO2 and CH4 correlate well with temperature throughout the record.

#   Abstract: A new ice core drilled at the Russian station of Vostok in Antarctica reached 2755 m depth in September 1993. At this depth, the glaciological time scale provides an age of 260 ky BP (±25). We refine this estimate using records of dust and deuterium in the ice and of δ18O of O2 in the entrapped air. δ18O of O2 is highly correlated with insolation over the last two climatic cycles if one assumes that the EGT chronology overestimates the increase of age with depth by 12% for ages older than 112 ky BP. This modified age-depth scale gives an age of 244 ky BP at 2755 m depth and agrees well with the age-depth scale of Walbroeck et al. (in press) derived by orbital tuning of the Vostok δD record. We discuss the temperature interpretation of this latter record accounting for the influence of the origin of the ice and using information derived from deuterium-excess data. We conclude that the warmest period of stage 7 was likely as warm as today in Antarctica. A remarkable feature of the Vostok record is the high level of similarity of proxy temperature records for the last two climatic cycles (stages 6 and 7 versus stages 1–5). This similarity has no equivalent in other paleorecords.

#   Abstract: A 2083 m deep ice core from Vostok Station (East Antarctica) has been used for a comprehensive study of all major ions (i.e. Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, H+, Cl−, NO3− and SO42− originating from aerosols deposited over the last climatic cycle (160,000 a), as depicted from the isotopic composition of the ice. For the first time in deep ice core studies, a good balance between anions and cations is obtained throughout the profile. This allows the clear identification of marine salts (i.e. sea salt and Na2SO4), terrestrial salts (calcium and magnesium associated with nitrates and sulfates) and strong mineral acids (HNO3, H2SO4 and HCl). Concentration profiles confirm that both marine and terrestrial aerosol inputs were higher during cold climatic conditions (from 110 to 15 ka B.P.) than during the Last Interglacial (centered around 130 ka B.P.) and the Holocene (the last 10,000 a) stages. High concentration peaks (up to 5 and 30 times the Holocene values of marine and terrestrial contents, respectively) are in particular observed during the very cold climate characterizing the end of the penultimate glacial age (~ 160 ka B.P.) and the Last Glacial Maximum which terminated around 15 ka B.P. These peaks reflect strengthened sources and transport during full glacial conditions, linked to higher wind speeds, more extensive arid areas on the continents and the greater exposure of continental shelves. More generally, marine and terrestrial aerosol concentrations measured in ice are strongly affected by climatic conditions of global (source strength and atmospheric transport efficiency) and local (rate of snow accumulation) concern. As opposed to marine and terrestrial inputs, acidic gas-derived impurity concentrations (HNO3, H2SO4) remain relatively stable over the whole climatic cycle. In particular there is no correlation between observed H2SO4 fluctuations and the isotope-temperature profile. This would indicate the absence of a long-term relationship between volcanism and climate. The mineral acid contribution represents a large part (over 50%) of ice impurities deposited during interglacial periods. For glacial ice the contribution of marine and terrestrial salts becomes preponderant (up to 75% of total soluble impurities). During interglacial stages and the relatively warm periods of the Last Glacial Age, significant quantities of either Na2SO4 or HCl are found, possibly resulting from marine aerosol alteration during atmospheric transport from sea sources towards Antarctica. On the other hand, the Cl/Nam ratio values indicate the presence of non-fractionated marine aerosols during full glacial conditions, confirming faster transport from sea sources towards Antarctica.

The past 150 kyr includes such a climatic cycle: the last interglacial, the last glacial and the present holocene interglacial. A new climatic–time series for this period has been obtained using δ18 O data from an Antarctic ice core.

#   Abstract: The 2,083-m Vostok ice core recovered by the Soviet Antarctic expeditions has provided much information of climatic and environmental interest, for a period covering a full glacial–interglacial cycle. Here we present and discuss the dust record obtained down to 2,202 m, the final depth to which this core was extended in 1986. First, we document the fact that major changes in aeolian deposits, as recorded in the Vostok core, appear to be of global significance and confirm the existence of a link between high-latitude aeolian deposits and the Earth's orbital parameters. Second, we propose atmospheric dust as a stratigraphic marker to compare timing with other records of palaeoclimate, and use the magnetic-susceptibility profile measured along the RC11-120 Indian Ocean core for this purpose, assuming that major dust events correspond to common aeolian inputs. This approach indicates that the Vostok and marine records were roughly in phase at the previous glacial–interglacial transition.

#   Abstract: The object of the present study is to introduce a means of comparing the Vostok and marine chronologies. Our strategy has been to use the δ18O of atmospheric O2 (denoted δ18Oatm) from the Vostok ice core as a proxy for the δ18O of seawater (denoted δ18Osw). Our underlying premise in using δ18Oatm as a proxy for δ18Osw is that past variations in δ18Osw (an indicator of continental ice volume) have been transmitted to the atmospheric O2 reservoir by photosynthesizing organisms in the surface waters of the world's oceans. We compare our record of δ18Oatm to the δ18Osw record which has been developed from studies of the isotopic composition of biogenic calcite (δ18Oforam) in deep-sea cores. We have tied our δ18Oatm record from Vostok to the SPECMAP timescale throughout the last 135 kyr by correlating δ18Oatm with a δ18Osw record from V19-30. Results of the correlation indicate that 77% of the variance is shared between these two records. We observed differences between the δ18Oatm and the δ18Osw records during the coldest periods, which indicate that there have been subtle changes in the factors which regulate δ18Oatm other than δ18Osw. Our use of δ18Oatm as a proxy for δ18Osw must therefore be considered tentative, especially during these periods. By correlating δ18Oatm with δ18Osw, we provide a common temporal framework for comparing phase relationships between atmospheric records (from ice cores) and oceanographic records constructed from deep-sea cores. Our correlated age-depth relation for the Vostok core should not be considered an absolute Vostok timescale. We consider it to be the preferred timescale for comparing Vostok climate records with marine climate records which have been placed on the SPECMAP timescale. We have examined the fidelity of this common temporal framework by comparing sea surface temperature (SST) records from sediment cores with an Antarctic temperature record from the Vostok ice core. We have demonstrated that when the southern ocean SST and Antarctic temperature records are compared on this common temporal framework, they show a high degree of similarity. We interpret this result as supporting our use of the common temporal framework for comparing other climate records from the Vostok ice core with any climate record that has been correlated into the SPECMAP chronology.
